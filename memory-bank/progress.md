# Project Progress

## What Works

### Community Engagement System
- ✅ Availability Dashboard
  - Location-based organization showing player availability
  - Weekly time slot view (Morning/Afternoon/Evening)
  - Currently playing view showing active players by location
  - Admin commands for viewing and posting the dashboard
  - Interactive navigation between locations
  - Schedule data aggregation by location and time
  - Support for posting to #hotspots dedicated channel
  - Refresh functionality to update with latest data
  - Integration with court locations from database
  - Smart fallback for schedules without specified locations

### Schedule Management System
- ✅ Command Structure
  - /schedule add - Create schedules with natural language input
  - /schedule view - View schedules with period filters
  - /schedule remove - Remove specific schedules
  - /schedule clear - Clear schedules for a period

- ✅ Core Features
  - Enhanced natural language time parsing
    - Multi-layered parsing strategy with pattern priority
    - Fixed "next week day" pattern handling
    - Fuzzy matching for typo correction
    - Support for complex time expressions
    - Recurring schedule patterns
    - Suggestion system for invalid inputs
  - Schedule conflict detection
  - Paginated schedule viewing
  - Location tracking
  - Period-based filtering
  - Confirmation dialogs

- ✅ Testing Infrastructure
  - Dedicated parser tests directory
  - Comprehensive test coverage
  - Test cases for edge cases
  - Pattern-specific test files
  - Organized test structure
  - Verified pattern matching order

- ✅ Data Layer
  - Schedule model with validation
  - DynamoDB integration
  - Efficient querying
  - Data access patterns

### Player Profile System
- ✅ Basic command structure for:
  - /get-started
  - /view-profile
  - /update-profile

- ✅ Skill Level Role System
  - Automatic role assignment based on NTRP rating
  - Five skill level roles with emoji prefixes:
    - 🌱 Beginner (NTRP 1.0-2.0)
    - 🎾 Advanced Beginner (NTRP 2.0-3.0)
    - 🎯 Intermediate (NTRP 3.0-4.0)
    - ⭐ Advanced Intermediate (NTRP 4.0-5.0)
    - 🏆 Advanced (NTRP 5.0+)
  - Integration with profile creation and update flows
  - Role hierarchy positioning above Club Member role
  - Note: Displaying role icons next to usernames in Discord requires a server boost

### Database Integration
- ✅ Player model with:
  - NTRP rating tracking
  - Interests list
  - Location preferences
  - Rating update cooldown system
  - Calibration period handling

- ✅ DynamoDB Migration
  - Models adapted for DynamoDB
  - DAOs implemented for DynamoDB
  - Docker setup for local development
  - AWS deployment configuration
  - Database initialization script
  - Seed data script for testing
  - Documentation for setup and usage
