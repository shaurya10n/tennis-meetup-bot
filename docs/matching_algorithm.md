# Tennis Player Matching Algorithm

## Overview

The Tennis Player Matching Algorithm is a sophisticated system that finds optimal tennis matches between players based on multiple compatibility factors. It considers NTRP ratings, skill level preferences, gender preferences, time availability, location preferences, and match history to create the best possible matches.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Factor Compatibility Scoring

The algorithm evaluates matches using a weighted scoring system:

- **NTRP Rating Compatibility (25%)**: Matches players with similar skill levels
- **Skill Level Preferences (20%)**: Respects player preferences for opponent skill levels
- **Gender Compatibility (15%)**: Considers gender preferences for matches
- **Location Compatibility (15%)**: Matches players who prefer the same courts
- **Time Overlap (15%)**: Ensures players are available at the same time
- **Engagement Bonus (5%)**: Rewards active players
- **Match History (5%)**: Considers previous match quality ratings

### 2. NTRP Rating Compatibility

The algorithm uses the National Tennis Rating Program (NTRP) to match players:

- **Excellent Match**: Within 0.5 NTRP rating (score: 1.0)
- **Good Match**: Within 1.0 NTRP rating (score: 0.8)
- **Acceptable Match**: Within 1.5 NTRP rating (score: 0.6)
- **Poor Match**: Within 2.0 NTRP rating (score: 0.3)
- **No Match**: Beyond 2.0 NTRP rating (score: 0.0)

### 3. Skill Level Preferences

Players can specify their preferred opponent skill levels:

- **Similar Level**: Â±0.5 NTRP rating
- **Above Level**: +1.0 NTRP rating
- **Below Level**: -1.0 NTRP rating
- **Any Level**: No preference

### 4. Gender Compatibility

The system respects gender preferences:

- **No Preference**: Compatible with any gender
- **Specific Gender**: Only matches with preferred gender
- **Partial Match**: Rewards when preferences align

### 5. Location Matching

Matches players who prefer the same courts:

- **Perfect Match**: Same preferred locations (score: 1.0)
- **Partial Match**: One player has no preference (score: 0.5)
- **No Match**: Different location preferences (score: 0.0)

### 6. Time Overlap Calculation

Calculates the percentage of time overlap between schedules:

```
overlap_score = overlap_duration / min(schedule1_duration, schedule2_duration)
```

### 7. Engagement Bonus

Rewards players with high engagement scores:

- Based on message activity, match participation, and overall engagement
- Normalized to 0-1 scale
- Encourages active community participation

### 8. Match History Factor

Considers previous match quality:

- **High Quality**: Previous match rated >7/10 (score: 1.0)
- **Good Quality**: Previous match rated >5/10 (score: 0.5)
- **No History**: No previous matches (score: 0.0)

## Algorithm Flow

### 1. Player Discovery

```python
# Find all available schedules in time range
available_schedules = get_schedules_in_time_range(start_time, end_time)

# Get all players for available schedules
all_players = get_players_for_schedules(guild_id, available_schedules)
```

### 2. Schedule Grouping

```python
# Group schedules by time overlap
overlapping_groups = group_schedules_by_overlap(player_schedule, available_schedules)
```

### 3. Match Generation

#### Singles Matches (2 players)

- Find all compatible players for each schedule
- Calculate pairwise compatibility scores
- Filter by minimum threshold (0.3)
- Sort by overall score

#### Doubles Matches (4 players)

- Find groups of 4 compatible players
- Calculate group compatibility (average of all pairwise scores)
- Filter by minimum threshold (0.25)
- Sort by overall score

### 4. Court Assignment

```python
# Find best court based on player preferences
suggested_court = find_best_court(player1, player2, schedule1, schedule2)

# Priority: Common locations > Any available court > None
```

### 5. Time Optimization

```python
# Find optimal match time within overlapping schedules
match_start, match_end = find_optimal_match_time(schedule1, schedule2)

# Default: 90 minutes with 15-minute warm-up
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Match Finding

```python
# Find matches for a player in the next week
suggestions = matching_algorithm.find_matches_for_player(
    guild_id="123456789",
    user_id="987654321",
    hours_ahead=168  # 1 week
)
```

### Schedule-Specific Matching

```python
# Find matches for a specific schedule
suggestions = matching_algorithm.find_matches_for_schedule(
    guild_id="123456789",
    schedule_id="schedule-uuid"
)
```

### Discord Command Integration

```python
# /find-matches command
await find_matches_command(interaction, hours_ahead=72)  # 3 days

# /find-matches-for-schedule command
await find_matches_for_schedule_command(interaction, schedule_id="uuid")
```

## Configuration

### Weights Configuration

```python
weights = {
    'ntrp_compatibility': 0.25,
    'skill_preference': 0.20,
    'gender_compatibility': 0.15,
    'location_compatibility': 0.15,
    'time_overlap': 0.15,
    'engagement_bonus': 0.05,
    'match_history': 0.05
}
```

### NTRP Thresholds

```python
ntrp_thresholds = {
    'excellent': 0.5,  # Within 0.5 rating
    'good': 1.0,       # Within 1.0 rating
    'acceptable': 1.5,  # Within 1.5 rating
